## Full-stack analytics... is that made up?
Maybe? 

Though, I am **not** the originator! The first time I heard of the term I was at an Adobe conference, where I came across [Frederik Werner's Full Stack Analyst Blog](https://www.fullstackanalyst.io/the-full-stack-analyst/).

It is a ~~generous~~  title that I have adopted in recent times to help communicate all of the things that I can do with data.

Some days, it means that I am a **Digital Analyst** pitching the value of analyzing customer fallthrough and retention in Adobe Analytics to my Product Manager.

Other days, it means that I am a **Data Analyst** writing SQL to query POS transaction data from the on-premises data warehouse, and running an affinity analysis in R. 

Still, on other days, I am a **Data Engineer** & **BI Developer** writing API GET requests in R or Python and creating data pipelines to be ingested and transformed into an insight-rich and user-friendly PowerBI Dashboard.

And finally on whatever days that are left, I become a **Data Scientist** that attempts to classify unstructured text data using a mixed membership approach to topic modeling in R. 

These are all the things that I have become over the years to be able to answer the problems that I find most interesting.

All jokes aside, I believe that a **full-stack analyst** is someone who is curious by nature and loves to apply their diverse assortment of analytical skills and techniques to solve valuable problems. 

That, or a generally informed and indecisive person as it relates to careers within data & analytics.
