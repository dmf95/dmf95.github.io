## Hello!

Welcome to my portfolio-blog! I’m Domenic, but you can call me Dom. Here, I share my journey in applied data science and personal milestones.

## About Me

I’m passionate about learning and growth. In my spare time, I enjoy sports, games, and sci-fi. I follow the NFL, NHL, and the Premier League, supporting the 49ers, Oilers, and Manchester United. My hobbies include soccer, running, board games, and video games like FIFA and Zelda. I also indulge in Fantasy Sports and Clash Royale.

I dive deep into data science, especially causal inference, which fuels my drive to uncover actionable insights. When I’m not working, I cherish time with my partner Vanessa and our dog Arlo. 

Explore more about my sports card collecting on [my dedicated site](https://www.goatsportscards.com/), where I go by *goat.sportscards*.

## What I Do

I help decision-makers by turning complex problems into clear, data-driven solutions. As a Sr. Data Scientist at [lululemon](https://shop.lululemon.com/), I build analytics pipelines and create data stories to enhance the retail experience.
