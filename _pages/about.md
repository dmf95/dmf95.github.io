With three years of experience in the field, I've honed my skills in crafting intuitive interfaces that connect users with products. In my experience as an intern at Visier, I helped define the vision of their Analytics solution with a focus on email scheduling and analysis editing. Recently, I've enjoyed working on freelance projects where I've designed digital solutions for clients in IT, film, health, and hospitality industries. 

My design philosophy is deeply rooted in empathy. I believe that understanding the users' needs, behaviors, and motivations is the cornerstone of crafting interfaces that resonate. My goal is to create experiences that not only function flawlessly, but also leave users with a sense of delight and satisfaction.

I'm activitely on the lookout for exciting new work opportunities!

When I'm not designing, I'm usually taking [photos of my dog](https://www.instagram.com/arlo.thetoy/), deciding what to eat next, or doing something [active like an Orangetheory class or run](https://www.strava.com/athletes/27274012).
