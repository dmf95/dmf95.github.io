## 39 minutes, and 41 seconds

That was the average number of minutes that Twitter stole from me each day in the month of June. 

And yes, I know what you're probably thinking - is it even appropriate to summarize with the mean?!

There definitely were a few days that we can call... outliers. The median was closer to 30 minutes.

## Building an app to analyze Twitter sentiment and topics

As I reflected on my mild Twitter addiction, I wondered what kind of sentiment & topics I was being subjected to. 

Naturally, this evolved into a data science project with my good friend and data wizard [Shannon Lo](https://shannonhlo.github.io/).

We decided to build an app that takes in a keyword and a number of tweets and outputs several text analytics insights that come from summarizing data from the Twitter API.


## Tweet Analyzer Streamlit App

In a future post, I will be covering the logic of our app. For now, feel free to explore the app and check out the source code available in our [github repo](https://github.com/shannonhlo/twitter-streamlit-app). 

I've iframed the app below. You can check out [the live app deployed on Streamlit here](https://share.streamlit.io/shannonhlo/twitter-streamlit-app/main/twitter_app.py).
